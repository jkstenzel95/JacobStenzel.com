With a mindset like that, what better a way to make things than by programming exciting software?\nJacob Stenzel began his journey into programming sometime around 2011 in a strange turn of events that even he hardly understands. After learning enough Java to scrape through an introductory computer science course at Monacan High School, he decided that Virginia Tech was the college for him and computer science his study of choice.\nAt Virginia Tech, Jacob found a passion for technology that makes people say \"Wow\" and enables them to do and to make exciting things of their own. As an instrument builder for the Laptop Orchestra, Jacob has gotten the unique opportunity to program intuitive, engaging, and flexible musical instruments through the use of gesture control devices like the Wii Remote. During his internship Fidelity, Jacob was given a chance to collaborate with systems analysts and developers to create an enhancement to the Plan Sponsor WebStation application to accommodate the submission of Qualified Medical Child Support Orders, a document with no standardized means of handling at the time.",
